- The Python files pertaining to each question have been submitted, along with a PDF document that also contains
  the code for each of the three questions. 
- Please note that for question 2, the program reads in 5 different datasets, i.e. one for each parking lot. 
  Each of these files are included with my submission (along with the original .csv files for the other two
  questions), which consist of "regression_dataset_lot1.csv", "regression_dataset_lot2.csv", "regression_dataset_lot3.csv",                 "regression_dataset_lot4.csv", and "regression_dataset_lot5.csv". Please ensure that these files are in your working
  directory or else the program for question 2 will not execute properly.
